    <p class="project-page__label">The landscape</p>
    <p class="project-page__body">Mental health came with stigma, and the last thing people wanted was another earnest, overly-precious meditation app. Meanwhile the category was drowning in the same visual clich&eacute;s — pastels, nature, soft whispers, and gentle hands resting on knees.</p>

    <div class="project-page__full-image placeholder">
      Pause — Image
    </div>

    <p class="project-page__label">The insight</p>
    <p class="project-page__body">Dark humour is how a lot of people actually deal with hard feelings. Instead of the expected "it's okay to not be okay" approach, we built Pause's brand voice around self-deprecating humour, honest emotional admission, and a tone that felt like talking to your sharpest friend — the one who makes you laugh about the thing you've been avoiding.</p>

    <div class="project-page__full-image placeholder">
      Pause — Image
    </div>
    <div class="project-page__image-grid">
      <div class="placeholder">Pause — Image</div>
      <div class="placeholder">Pause — Image</div>
    </div>

    <p class="project-page__label">The outcome</p>
    <p class="project-page__body">When an entire category competes on sincerity, the funniest voice in the room wins. Pause launched with a 70+ NPS and a brand that didn't feel like a brand — it felt like a group chat. Users didn't just use the app, they shared it — because the content was worth sharing independent of the product.</p>
